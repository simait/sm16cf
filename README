Usage should be quite obvious, something like:

sm16cf \
	--device <serial device>\
	--baud-rate 57600\
	--input-file <input file>\
	--flash-program

HOWEVER, should you however need to do something else, perhaps just erase the
flash, there is an advanced interface that is supressed in the help. Just take
a look in the m16c/M16CFlashApp.py file for what this application is capable
of. Just remember, this is _very_ much not unsupported code so if things go
wrong you are pretty much on your own.
